# TDP-productivity-Spring
Spring repository for the final code project of the YER Java Talent Development Programme. Our team made a productivity management product.

This is a deploy-ready webapplication that allows users to create projects and create tasks within those projects using postgresql, Spring MVC, Maven and Angular.
It features user accounts, a workflow, deadlines and a selection page that shows what tasks need to be done based on input how much spare time the user has and which project he wants to work on.

The angular code can be found in the repository https://github.com/EdwinBolt/TDP-productivity-Angular. 

This work is a combined effort of https://github.com/EdwinBolt, https://github.com/PCvdScheer and https://github.com/IvHaaften
